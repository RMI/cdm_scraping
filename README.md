This repo scrapes project design documents (PDD) from the Clean Development Mechanism Registry (https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/projsearch.html) based on project reference number. The script can be tailored to scrape all CDM PDD documents, which will be valuable to get emissions related project metadata for waste and oil and gas sectors.
